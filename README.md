## Exploring Patterns and Shifts: Factor Analysis of the First and Second-Level Digital Divide in Italian Enterprises![image](https://github.com/luchocastillo84/Factor_Analysis_Digital_Divide/assets/65243923/47536ee5-7a86-4b69-96c4-cc73248d28dd)


## Introduction
This repository contains supplementary materials for the manuscript "Exploring Patterns and Shifts: Factor Analysis of the First and Second-Level Digital Divide in Italian Enterprises." The aim of the project is to understand the digital divide among Italian firms through a comprehensive analysis using Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). This repository includes codes, statistical reports, preprocessing steps, and results that provide detailed insights into the study.
